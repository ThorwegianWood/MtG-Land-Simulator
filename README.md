Simulate the early turns of an MtG game to see your chance of casting a certain spell on curve, given your mana base.
Currently does not treat any dual lands differently, and has no support for cheap card-draw spells that can smooth out your mana curve.
It's also pretty slow.

Programmed in Python 3 and using PyQt5 for the GUI.

Most assumptions come from articles like https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/how-many-lands-do-you-need-to-consistently-hit-your-land-drops/
